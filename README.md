### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eryk Olsza and I'm an Software Developer.

I have a strong passion for learning how things work at a deeper level. During work I've had my fair share of hands-on experience with front-end and back-end. I'm definately more of a back-end fan though. I'm exploring computer graphics in my free time. My background:

My current projects (and one of my favourites so far) is a raytracing engine, written from scratch in C# following Clean Architecture principles, showcasing my interest in graphics programming and the math behind it.
  * I'm attemting to get familiar with Rust during this years Advent of Code.
